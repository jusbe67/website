  <p  class="large indigo"> There are subtle, even nuanced differences between Cyber and Steam but I love both genres as much and they have long influenced my jewellery design and artwork.
    Since William Gibson, the iconic science fiction writer coined the term "cyberpunk" it has stirred the imaginations of the sci-fi community worldwide. My first encounters with the sci-fi genre were from reading the Eagle comic as a kid and wanting to be Dan Dare battling the Venusian Mekon. The character was created by illustrator Frank Hampson (a clergyman from Southport, where I spent my teenage years) who also wrote the first stories. <br>
     Following this I became an avid collector and reader of all 800 of the first copies of 2000AD comic. I still follow online today in fact. This comic spawned such legends as Rogue trooper, the ABC warriors, a film named "Hardware" with a cameo from Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead and of course the ever popular Judge Dredd. A future judge jury and executioner in one from the Mega cities of the future which are not a million miles from the reality of some cities today. <br>
     When I became involved in jewellery through the influence of Ren√© Lalique, I noticed his designs and attempts to use their influence became twisted in my warped idea of the future. Other influences became prevalent, ranging from HR Geiger, designer of the artwork for the Alien film franchise and a Debbie Harry album cover. This lead to an exploratioon of the concept of biomechanics
